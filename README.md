</p>

Facefull bridge is a communication system which connects application native backend (C++/Java/etc...) and Facefull user interface (runs through webview component). 
This library allows you to use Facefull to create a user interface for native desktop applications using the webview component. In native mode you can use built-in event system to communicate with your native desktop application C++ backend.

This library contains Facefull bridge interface and bridge implementation for wxWidgets (webview/webkit) and Qt5 (webkit) frameworks.
You can use predefined implementations or create your own.

A web bridge mode is also available. In this mode, the backend application runs an HTTP server and provides communication between the native C++ code and Facefull frontend via the bridge system.
